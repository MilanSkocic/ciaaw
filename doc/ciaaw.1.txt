SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
       ciaaw  is  a  command  line  interface which provides the atomic
       weights, the  isotopic  compositions  and  the  nuclides  atomic
       weights.   If  no element is provided the full periodic table is
       displayed.

OPTIONS
       --saw, -s
              Get the standard atomic weight.

              Get the nuclide atomic weight.

       --mu, -m
              Get the molar masses in g/mol by multiplying  the  atomic
              weights by the molar mass contant Mu.

       --colnames, -c
              Show the headers in the outputs.

       --usage, -u
              Show usage text and exit.

NOTES
       You  may  replace  the default options from a file if your first
       options begin with @file.  Initial options  will  then  be  read
       from the "response file" "file.rsp" in the current directory.

       If "file" does not exist or cannot be read, then an error occurs
       and  the  program  stops. Each line of the file is prefixed with
       "options" and interpreted as a separate argument. The  file  it‐
       self  may  not  contain  @file  arguments.  That  is,  it is not
       processed recursively.

       For more information on response files see
